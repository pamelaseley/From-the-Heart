    <h1>From the Heart</h1>
    <p>I don't have many words,<br>
    But I think from the heart;<br>
    For this feeling I'm feeling,<br>
    I can never depart.</p>
 
    <p>I don't have much to offer,<br>
    But I'm giving it all;<br>
    It's the only way I know,<br>
    To make sure you stand tall.</p>
 
    <p>It's not about the money,<br>
    Or the things you may own;<br>
    It's about how you feel inside,<br>
    And the things that are shown.</p>
 
    <p>It's about the moments,<br>
    That you treasure each day;<br>
    When the feeling of love inside you,<br>
    Refuses to go away.</p>
 
    <p>It's about the emotions,<br>
    That words can't explain;<br>
    The feeling in your heart,<br>
    When you experience something so plain.</p>
 
    <p>It's about the joy,<br>
    That comes from the love within;<br>
    It's about the way you feel,<br>
    When you learn to truly forgive.</p>
 
    <p>It's about the times,<br>
    When you're feeling down;<br>
    It's about the courage to rise,<br>
    And turn that frown around.</p>
 
    <p>It's about the times,<br>
    When you feel all alone;<br>
    It's about the strength to carry on,<br>
    To make it on your own.</p>
 
    <p>It's about the people,<br>
    That help you along the way;<br>
    The ones who stay by your side,<br>
    Even when you feel on display.</p>
 
    <p>It's about the laughter,<br>
    That comes from deep inside;<br>
    It's about the way you feel,<br>
    When you can't help but smile.</p>
 
    <p>It's about the memories,<br>
    That never go away;<br>
    It's about the times,<br>
    That you just want to stay.</p>
 
    <p>And it's about the love,<br>
    That comes from the heart;<br>
    It's the only thing that matters,<br>
    When it comes down to the start.</p>
